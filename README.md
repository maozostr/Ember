Ember General Info
------------------
The Ember project has been mining on an old wallet that has been abandoned. The wallet has not been touched since 2014. The seed infrastructure is all down. Builtin addresses are down. Did the original dev get hit by a bus? Regardless, it's time to fix this, and show the world the potential for the phoenix rebirth of Ember.
